Example based on [my blog post](http://redningja.com/dev_blog/piggyback-github-gists-for-dev-blogging).

This is a minimal installation of Jekyll to demonstrate how to easily piggy back github gists.
A stylesheet was added for minor cosmetics.
And a prefix was added to the permalink to work with github pages.

Also, see the note in `_layouts/default.html` about the stylesheet prefix.
This shouldn't be needed for a github user page.
